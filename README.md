Extra Medium
============

Miss Medium's old collection functionality? Me too. This Meteor app aims to restore/replace it. In case you forgot, collections used to be more open. A user could:

1. submit an article/story to **any** collection without having to be pre-approved as a "writer" by the collection owner.  
2. submit an article/story to **multiple** collections, not just one.

The app is super ugly right now while I work on building out the basic relationships and functionality, but that's OK because of [The Iceberg Secret](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000356.html), right?

Perhaps in the future, Extra Medium can be made into a browser extension that directly modifies the Medium website, but for now, it's a standalone app you can run in another tab/window. Also, I'm not trying to reinvent anything Medium already does (e.g. comments on articles, bookmarks, recommendations, etc.). Instead, the goal is to provide a better way to discover content on Medium by restoring collections to their former open-spirited glory. Maybe it can add a few extras too!
